<h3>Description</h3>
<p>I tried many types of ceviche, none to my liking, so I made my own. I hope you enjoy it. It looks appetizing 
and it's really good, especially for hangovers. It's Sinaloa-style because of the slices of jalapenos and red onions. 
It's a delicate, classy dish. Serve on tostadas with Tapatio® hot sauce, sliced avocados, and Mexican beer.
